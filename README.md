# zlib

This is a fork of zlib that adds support for building using [Forge](https://github.com/cwbaker/forge).

Changes are made in the *forge-v0.0.x* branch (the default branch for this fork).  The changes will be rebased onto the *master* branch when changes are pulled from upstream at [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib).
